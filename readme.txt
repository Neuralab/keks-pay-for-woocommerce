KEKS Pay for WooCommerce.

== Description ==

KEKS Pay for WooCommerce offers you a simple and seamless way of taking KEKS Pay payments. Your customers will have the best time saving user experience in the checkout process - especially while buying on smartphones. It will increase your conversion-rate and the likeliness to return to your shop. On the other hand, via KEKS Pay you will be able to accept VISA, Mastercard, Maestro or Diners Club cards and payments directly from your customer's bank account.

Currently KEKS Pay for WooCommerce is available for merchants only in CROATIA.

== Why choose KEKS Pay? ==

KEKS Pay has no setup fees, no monthly fees, no hidden costs - you only get charged when you take payments through KEKS Pay. Earnings are transferred to your bank account on a 1-day rolling basis. 

Cancel whenever you want without additional costs.

== How to refund a KEKS Pay payment? ==

To do a refund, select the order and click the Refund button afterward. You will be able to type in the amount you would refund. The order status will change to “Refunded” once the order has been successfully refunded.

On a side note, this plugin is provided “as-is” and we don't currently provide support around installing and optimizing it for your needs.
